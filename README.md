## ⚡ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tharshan2001/CloudBox.git
   cd cloud-box-storage

2. **Build the project:**
   ./mvnw clean install

3. **Run the app:**
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run

   

## **Configuration**

API Endpoints

Authentication

/auth/register – Register a new user

/auth/login – Login and receive JWT token

Files

Upload multiple files
POST /upload
FormData: files (array, max 10 files)
Response: List of streaming URLs

Stream / download file
GET /meta/{fileKey}
Public streaming (or secure if JWT enforced)

List user files
GET /my-files
Returns FileDTO list: filename, relative path, fileKey, uploadedAt

Delete file
DELETE /delete/{fileKey}
Deletes file if owned by the user


## **File Storage Structure**       

/storage
   ├── 1                  # userId = 1
   │   ├── 1674132123123_filename1.txt
   │   └── 1674132123456_filename2.jpg
   └── 2                  # userId = 2
       └── 1674132136789_image.png


## **Security**       

JWT-based authentication

Each file is associated with a user

Only the owner can delete their files
Streaming can be made private by enforcing JWT (currently public for testing)


## **Future Improvements**   

- File size and type validation

- Pagination for file listing

- Shareable public links

- Search / filter files

- Logging and analytics

- Integration tests

- Add Clusters for more organizing (Boxes) 


## **Notes**   


- Maximum 10 files per upload

- Files are stored uniquely to prevent overwriting
  Metadata is required for streaming files correctly
